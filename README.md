# MPX68K

A Sharp X68000 computer emulator for macOS platforms, based on the px68k emulator core.
This repository is indirectly a fork of Mr. Hissorii's [px68k](https://github.com/hissorii/px68k). Based on his source code, [Goroman](https://github.com/GOROman) converted it for iOS, and I made it work on MacOS.

## Overview

## System Requirements

### macOS
- macOS 15.0 or later
- Apple Silicon Mac recommended (Intel Macs supported)
- Minimum 4GB RAM
- 1GB free disk space for ROM and disk images

## ROM Files Setup

MPX68K requires original SHARP X68000 system ROM files to function properly. These files are **not included** with the emulator and must be obtained separately.

### Required ROM Files

You need the following ROM files from an original X68000 system:

| File | Description | Size |
|------|-------------|------|
| `CGROM.DAT` | Character Generator ROM | 768KB |
| `IPLROM.DAT` | Initial Program Loader ROM | 128KB |

### Installation Locations

Place the ROM files in the location:

1. **iCloud Document folder**:
   ```
   /Users/<username>/Documents/X68000 (/Users/<username>/Libraries/Containers/X68000/Data)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CGROM.DAT
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IPLROM.DAT
   ```

### Important Notes

- **Legal Notice**: ROM files are copyrighted by SHARP CORPORATION. You must own an original X68000 system to legally use these files.
- **File Names**: ROM file names are case-sensitive and must be exactly `CGROM.DAT` and `IPLROM.DAT`.
- **File Integrity**: Ensure ROM files are not corrupted. The emulator will display an error if files are missing or invalid.
- **Backup**: Always keep backup copies of your ROM files in a safe location.

### Verification

When ROM files are properly installed, the emulator will:
1. Load without ROM-related error messages
2. Display the characteristic X68000 boot screen
3. Show proper Japanese character rendering

If you see garbled text or boot failures, verify that your ROM files are correctly placed and named.

## Installation

### Building from Source

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YosAwed/MPX68K.git
   cd MPX68K
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode:**
   ```bash
   open X68000.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Build the project:**
   - Select your target platform (macOS)
   - Build and run (‚åò+R)

### Dependencies
The project includes a dependency on the c68k CPU emulator which is built automatically.

## Usage

### macOS Controls

#### FDD Management
- **FDD ‚Üí Open Drive 0...** (‚åò1): Insert disk into Drive 0
- **FDD ‚Üí Open Drive 1...** (‚åò2): Insert disk into Drive 1
- **FDD ‚Üí Eject Drive 0** (‚áß‚åò1): Eject disk from Drive 0
- **FDD ‚Üí Eject Drive 1** (‚áß‚åò2): Eject disk from Drive 1

#### HDD Management
- **HDD ‚Üí Open Hard Disk...** (‚åòH): Insert hard disk image
- **HDD ‚Üí Eject Hard Disk** (‚áß‚åòH): Eject hard disk image

#### Display Management
- **Display ‚Üí Rotate Screen** (‚åòR): Rotate screen between landscape and portrait modes
- **Display ‚Üí Landscape Mode**: Set to standard horizontal orientation
- **Display ‚Üí Portrait Mode (90¬∞)**: Set to vertical orientation for tate games

#### Joycard Input
- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**: 8-direction movement
- **Space** or **J**: Button A
- **Z** or **K**: Button B
- **Mouse**: Click on visual joycard buttons

## File Formats

| Extension | Description | Type | Platform Support | Security |
|-----------|-------------|------|-------------------|----------|
| .dim | Standard disk image | Floppy | macOS | Validated |
| .xdf | Extended disk format | Floppy | macOS | Validated |
| .d88 | D88 disk format | Floppy | macOS | Validated |
| .hdf | Hard disk format | Hard Disk | macOS | Validated |
| .hdm | Hard disk format (alt) | Hard Disk | macOS | Validated |

### Hard Disk Usage

Hard disk images provide faster access and larger storage capacity compared to floppy disks:

1. **Loading HDD Images**: Use **HDD ‚Üí Open Hard Disk...** menu or drag .hdf files
2. **Boot Priority**: When both FDD and HDD are present, X68000 boots from FDD first (if a bootable disk is inserted), then falls back to HDD
3. **Performance**: HDDs offer significantly faster loading times for large applications
4. **Capacity**: Support for larger disk images suitable for complex software suites
5. **Persistence**: Changes to HDD images are automatically saved

#### Boot Order Behavior
The X68000 follows the authentic boot sequence:
1. **FDD First**: Always checks Drive 0 for bootable disk
2. **HDD Fallback**: If no bootable FDD is present, boots from HDD
3. **System Disk Override**: Insert a system floppy to boot from FDD even with HDD installed

#### Recommended Usage
- **System Boot**: Install X68000 system on HDD for faster startup when no FDD is inserted
- **Applications**: Store large software packages on HDD
- **Development**: Use HDD for compilers and development tools
- **Games**: Multi-disk games can be consolidated onto HDD
- **Boot Override**: Use system floppies to boot specific programs or perform maintenance

### Screen Rotation (Tate Mode)

The X68000 emulator supports 90-degree screen rotation for vertical games, commonly known as "tate mode":

#### Supported Games
- **Dragon Spirit**: Classic vertical shooter requiring portrait orientation
- **Other Vertical Games**: Any X68000 game designed for vertical play

#### Usage
1. **Rotate Screen**: Use **Display ‚Üí Rotate Screen** (‚åòR) to toggle between orientations
2. **Direct Selection**: Choose **Display ‚Üí Portrait Mode (90¬∞)** for vertical games
3. **Window Adjustment**: macOS automatically resizes the window for optimal display
4. **Control Consistency**: Joycard controls remain unchanged regardless of rotation

#### Technical Features
- **Smooth Rotation**: SpriteKit-based rotation with proper aspect ratio maintenance
- **Persistent Settings**: Rotation preference is saved and restored between sessions
- **Optimal Scaling**: Automatic scaling ensures games fill the available screen space
- **No Performance Impact**: Rotation processing doesn't affect emulation performance

## Architecture

MPX68K uses a multi-layered architecture that bridges modern Swift UI frameworks with low-level C/C++ emulation code.

### Language Stack
- **Swift**: UI layer, device management, file system, logging infrastructure
